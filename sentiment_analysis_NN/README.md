# Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model using neural networks. The goal is to classify text data (such as reviews, tweets, or comments) into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The project leverages various neural network architectures to achieve high accuracy in sentiment classification.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Training neural network models for sentiment analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using various metrics.
- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict sentiment on new data.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - Ensure the dataset is in the correct format (e.g., CSV with columns for text and sentiment labels).

2. **Training the Model**:
   - Run the Jupyter Notebook `main.ipynb` to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
   - You can adjust the neural network architecture and parameters in the notebook.

3. **Predicting Sentiment**:
   - Use the trained model to predict sentiment on new text data.
   - Load the model and use the prediction functions defined in the notebook.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK or SpaCy
